2. Peel and then grate one small turmeric root, before chopping slightly and adding to the pan.

3. Grate a little nutmeg, and then add it to the pan together with the cinnamon and cardamom.

4. Keep on a low heat stirring regularly for around five minutes until slightly steaming. Do not boil as the milk will burn.

5. Check for taste and add more spice as required.

6. Once ready, use a wooden spoon to strain the turmeric from the liquid as you transfer into a cup. For extra comfort, warm the cup with hot water before pouring the liquid from the pan. Makes one serving.
